# Wordle Clone DSA Performance Tests
<img width="826" alt="WCDSA-featured-image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75151961/205560270-e4bba031-12da-4ca8-911e-2df31a5fa44e.png">

Component rerender time performance tests through React Profiler comparing the performance of a stateful board and a stateless board for Wordle Clone DSA. The tests are exposed through a TestsInterface component that allows running the tests right from the UI (user interface). Test results are displayed right on the UI as well. While running, the tests' data can be observed from the browser's console. 

## Test Results Discussion
You can find a discussion about the tests along with a data table for 30 test trials in my blog post <em>Designing Wordle: Wordle Clone DSA, Part II: Data Implementation</em>, section Rerendering the Board Component, Method II: Using Stateless Variables plus a Switch State Variable. 

## Codesandbox

## Local Testing
To run the tests locally, download this repo from your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/mmartinezluis/wordle-clone-dsa-performance-tests.git```

cd into the project:

```cd wordle-clone-dsa-performance-tests```

and start the React client:

```npm start```



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
